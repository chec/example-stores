# Example stores available in the Chec CLI demo-stores

The manifest data includes the list of demo stores available to clone directly from the Chec CLI `chec demo-store` command.

To add an example store to the list of `demo-stores` in the Chec CLI, go to `manifest.json` file and include the new repo and its data as a new item object.
